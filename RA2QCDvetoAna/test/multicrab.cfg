# Section [COMMON] is common for all datasets
# General idea: you define all the parameter in the template (crab.cfg), 
# but you might want to change the template values for all dataset.
# The general syntax is that you first put the crab.cfg [SECTION] and
# the the crab.cfg [key], with a "." in between, exactly as you would do
# to pass to CRAB keys via command line.

# This determines the direcory where the CRAB log files and CMSSW output files will go.
# It will be USER.ui_working_dir/section_name/
# where section_name is the corresponding  section "[xyz]" that you give below.

# This determines both the location in dcache and the published name in DBS. 
# The former will be of the form /input_dataset_name/USER.publish_data_name/.../
# The latter will be of the form /input_dataset_name/myname-USER.publish_data_name-.../USER

# Below we have a section for each dataset you want to access (or, more precisely,
# any task you want to create).
# The name of the section will be used as USER.ui_working_dir, so the
# stuff for this dataset will be found in Wmunu/ directory.
# Any name is allowed (but MULTICRAB and COMMON) and any number of
# sections can be added
# The syntax for the parameters is the one described before
# SECTION.key=value
# and any parameter can be changed. Otherwise, the template one will be
# used.
